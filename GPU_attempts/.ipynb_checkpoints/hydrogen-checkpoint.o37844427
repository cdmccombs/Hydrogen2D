nvcc_wrapper does not accept standard flags -std=c++1z since partial standard flags and standards after C++17 are not supported. nvcc_wrapper will use -std=c++14 instead. It is undefined behavior to use this flag. This should only be occurring during CMake configuration.
Build failed. Please check the error messages.
